< Immune checkpoints (ICs) function by modulating the immune response, in order to maintain self-tolerance and restrict the duration of the immune response [3]. T cell activation, through antigen recognition by the T cell receptor (TCR), is tightly regulated by the balance between co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory signals. Two of these co-inhibitory ICs, CTLA-4 and PD-1, have been studied extensively for their roles in cancer. CTLA-4 is a co-inhibitory molecule with the ability to directly inhibit T cell activation, as it counteracts CD28 co-stimulation by outcompeting its binding to their mutual ligands, CD80 and CD86 [4,5]. PD-1 is another inhibitory IC expressed on the cell surface of T cells, which is upregulated on T cells with an “exhausted” phenotype, following prolonged antigen exposure [6]. The blocking of co-inhibitory ICs to treat cancer has shown promising results in clinical trials [7–9]. Consequently, in 2011, the monoclonal antibody blocking CTLA-4 (Ipilimumab) was approved by the FDA for the treatment of advanced melanoma, followed by the approval of a PD-1-blocking monoclonal antibody (Pembrolizumab) for the treatment of melanoma in 2014, and the approval of a PD-L1 blocking antibody (Atezolizumab) for the treatment of urothelial carcinoma in 2016 [10–12]. Since then, several additional PD-1 and PD-L1 blocking antibodies have entered the market. Besides

< tumor cell vaccine applied a genetic in vivo CRISPR-Cas9 screen and identified several potential therapy-resistance genes [77]. Based on the top 50 most-depleted genes, four different signaling pathways associated with the sensitivity of tumor cells to treatment with immunotherapy were revealed, being TNF signaling/NFκB activation, the inhibition of kinase signaling, the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and antigen processing and presentation [77]. For each of these pathways, a representative gene was selected, based on the highest cumulative score as ranked by the STARS algorithm. These genes were Ripk1 for the TNF signaling/NFκB activation pathway, Ptpn2 for the inhibition of kinase signaling pathway, Stub1 for the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and H2-T23 for the antigen processing and presentation pathway [77]. Notably, H2-T23 encodes Qa-1b (a mouse homolog of HLA-E), the ligand for the inhibitory receptor NKG2A, for which we demonstrated importance in mechanisms of acquired resistance to cancer vaccines, which may be alleviated by new antibodies to block NKG2A [14,15]. The involvement of the antigen processing and presentation pathway in immunotherapy resistance was confirmed in another CRISPR-based screen, which focused on the genes controlling HLA class I expression [78]. Here, IRF2 was identified as a rate limiting factor for TAP-mediated peptide transport to the endoplasmic reticulum and subsequent N-terminal trimming and thus antigen presentation [78]. IRF2 is frequently downregulated in tumors. TAP deficiency has been demonstrated in many cancer types and shown to correlate with disease progression and clinical outcomes [79–81]. Interestingly, tumor cells with such antigen processing defects still express MHC-I molecules, which then present T cell epitopes associated with impaired peptide processing (TEIPP) [82–84]. Priming TEIPP-specific T cells with vaccines to overcome acquired immune resistance has been proposed as a treatment strategy for tumors with impaired TAP expression, and this approach has been proven effective in inhibiting the outgrowth of immune-escaped tumors in mice [85,86]. Unexpectedly, the expression of MHC-II molecules was also detected on tumor cells and shown to correlate with T cell infiltration and the therapeutic response to CPI, indicating the presence of alternative antigen presentation pathways [87,88]. Notably, a lack of appropriate levels of tumor-specific antigen forms another important intrinsic resistance pathway against CPI [89]. In another screen, for key components determining the susceptibility of tumor cells to adoptively transferred effector cells, the GTPase Cdc42 was identified as a key factor in preventing CTL-induced cell death via MAPK signaling and posttranscriptional Bcl-2 stabilization [90]. Cdc42 is highly expressed in invasive cancers. Oncogenic MAPK signaling results in the production of immunosuppressive factors (e.g., VEGF, IL-6 and IL-10), which inhibit the proliferation and activation status of tumor-specific T cells and DCs [91]. In line with this, loss of the tumor suppressor gene PTEN has been shown to correlate with resistance against cancer immunotherapies, through the enhanced signaling of both the MAPK and PI3K signaling cascades [92,93]. Activation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway can contribute to therapy resistance by directly promoting tumor cell proliferation and survival, as well as the upregulation of PD-L1 cell surface expression, thereby inhibiting the function of local effector T cells [94]. Moreover, enhanced PI3K signaling via alternative AKT-independent pathways also acts on the antigen presenting pathway, as it results in the downregulation of HLA expression and escape from T cell recognition [95]. In addition to the MAPK and PI3K signaling cascades, the WNT/β-catenin pathway has also been implicated in resistance to cancer immunotherapies. A melanoma study on primary resistance against αPD-L1/αCTLA-4 antibody combination treatment revealed that the activation of the WNT/β-catenin pathway inhibits CD103+ DC-mediated T cell priming, resulting in a decreased infiltration of tumor-specific T cells to the TME [96]. Additionally, soluble melanoma-derived Wnt5a can alter local DC metabolism, leading to increased indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO) enzymatic activity and suppressed IL-6 and IL-12 production, thereby creating an immunosuppressive environment that promotes Treg development [97,98]. This IDO-driven Treg increase in the TME has been identified as a resistance mechanism against CTLA-4 and PD-1 CPI [98,99]. Notably, crosstalk between the MAPK, PI3K and WNT signaling pathways through the phosphorylation of cascade components occurs, making the targeting of these pathways to overcome immunotherapy resistance a complex ordeal [100,101].

< and death. A CRISPR-based in vitro and in vivo screen to identify mechanisms allowing tumor escape from CD8+ T cells and natural killer cells showed that the deletion of Casp8, Tnfrsf1a and Ado within the TNF-signaling pathway, or Ifngr1/2, Jak1/2 and Stat1 in the IFN-γ-signaling pathway, protected tumor cells against CD8+ T cell and/or NK cell-mediated killing and blunted the efficacy of anti-tumor responses in vivo [102]. In addition, the upregulation of the TNF receptor 2 (TNFR2) on tumor cells may foster tumor cell growth over TNFR1-induced killing after the binding of TNF-α [96]. Additionally, loss-of-function mutations or the downregulation of genes involved in the IFN-γ signaling pathway— such as Ifngr1, Ifngr2, Jak1/2 and Irf1—were shown in patients who were irresponsive to αCTLA-4 antibody treatment and correlated to primary and adaptive resistance against αPD-L1 checkpoint blockade [103,104]. Primary resistance to CPI via alterations in antigen processing and presentation, as well as in responsiveness to IFN-γ signaling, was confirmed in a predictive biomarker study using single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from melanoma patients classified as untreated, CPI responsive or CPI resistant [105]. Taken together, the tumor cell extrinsic and intrinsic mechanisms driving immunotherapeutic resistance are versatile, yet tightly interwoven, making combination therapy an appealing therapeutic approach. It will be of interest to see if strategies that deal with these extrinsic and intrinsic primary resistance mechanisms will elucidate yet-unidentified mechanisms of resistance.

< Due to limited research on the extrinsic factors fostering the development of secondary resistance to immunotherapy, there are only a few studies reporting the association between the attraction of immunosuppressive cells and the development of secondary resistance. In mice, the relapse of tumors after initial responses to combination therapy including dual CPI and radiotherapy was associated with an increase in Tregs in the TME [116]. These Tregs were phenotypically similar to those that were described to mediate primary resistance against immunotherapies, since RNAseq analysis of these cells revealed an increased expression of genes involved in TGF-β and IL-10 signaling. In another study, the increased expression of Tim-3 on the surface of Tregs in the TME was suggested to inhibit the local anti-tumor T cell response induced by mono CPI in combination with radiotherapy, leading to secondary resistance. Similarly, the accumulation of MDSCs in the TME was shown in patients that developed secondary resistance after initial responses to CPI [117]. These MDSCs were found to

< In order to delineate the underlying mechanisms of primary and secondary resistance, we advocate the investigation of so-called dichotomous responses in animal models. Even in the controlled conditions of inbred syngeneic mice and optimized treatment protocols, variation between animals is observed in terms of responsiveness to immunotherapy. This was described for the occurrence of secondary resistance in mice treated with the combination therapy α-CTLA-4 and αPD-1, after cDC1 anti-cancer vaccination and after combined treatment with CPI and an anti-tumor vaccine [118–120]. This dichotomous response makes mouse models an ideal alternative for new studies on the underlying mechanisms involved in secondary resistance to immunotherapy, and in some cases, they also may provide new leads to overcome this type of resistance. For instance, prolonged exposure to IFN-γ can result in acquired resistance to the combination of radiation therapy and α-CTLA-4, in line with human studies [107]. The application of genetically altered mice and tumor cell lines, as well as the application of other CPIs, revealed that this resistance was related to IFN-γ signaling pathway related events, including the upregulation of PD-L1, but also involved other regulatory pathways [107]. Well-defined extrinsic resistance mechanisms, as unraveled in mouse tumor models—with available research reagents, the depletion of antibodies and genetic knock-out systems—need to be confirmed operationally in cancer patients (Figure 2). This requires cancer samples from cohorts of refractory patients treated with the respective form of immunotherapy. Although challenging, we recently showed this to be feasible [121]. Immune suppressive myeloid cells were present at elevated levels in tumor-bearing mice and in patients treated with a therapeutic vaccine, resulting in a lower therapeutic efficacy and the suppression of spontaneous tumor-specific T cell reactivity, respectively [122]. Gemcitabine and the combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel both depleted MDSCs in mice, but only the latter was able to decrease the percentage of immune suppressive MDSCs in cancer patients with stronger spontaneous and vaccine-induced T cell reactivities, as well as result in clinical benefits [52,122,123]. Notably, the standard of care in humans is still directed at the tumor itself (chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery), and immunotherapies are, for now, mainly administered to patients with a history of at least one previous anti-cancer therapy. Along these same lines, we have to assume that each form of immunotherapy will yield its own unique resistance mechanism. This, together with human heterogeneity, should be taken into consideration when using mouse models to mirror the human cancer immunotherapy experience. Nevertheless, some acquired resistance mechanisms discovered in mouse tumor models are also operational in cancer patients, validating the use of mouse tumor models to identify not only secondary therapy mechanisms but also ways to overcome them (Figure 2) [106,107,111]. An important question, although harder to address, is what the factors within a tumor that determine the fate of the tumor during immunotherapy in the first place are. In general, this is easily overlooked since treatment responses in animal models are mostly studied at the stage in which regressor mice can be separated from non-regressors after therapy.
